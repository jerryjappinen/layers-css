# Layers CSS changelog

Latest official changelog is available on the web at [https://github.com/jerryjappinen/layers-css](https://github.com/jerryjappinen/layers-css/blob/master/changelog.md).



## 1.2.0 - Friday May 29, 2015

- Using attribute selectors in progressively enhanced `.columns` for big file size reductions.
- Added progressively enhanced `.column.first` support to explicitly mark the first column of a row (for each breakpoint).
- You can now mark elements `.hidden-over-` and `.hidden-under-` breakpoints.
- `input.plain` removes magical focus outlines on webkit
- Typography basics are set for `html`, not `body`
- `border-radius` is reset for `.plain` inputs on iOS Safari as expected



## 1.1.2 - Monday December 29, 2014

- Bugfix: `:not()` used only in separate declarations, so non-compliant browsers don't ignore other declarations. Affects some input-related declarations in IE8, for example.



## 1.1.1 - Monday November 17, 2014

- Normalizing `i` and `b` in `_normalize.css`.
- Progressively enhanced `.reset` columns can be overwritten to go full-width as expected.



## 1.1.0 - Sunday October 3, 2014

### Miscellaneous fixes

- `width: 100%; height: 100%;` added to normalizations for `html` and `body`.
- Some `input` definitions are less specific.
- Resetting border-radius in `.plain` inputs and buttons.
- Also added `.fifth`-width columns.
- `.row` and `.row-content` clear floats. However, they're still completely optional.

### New responsive adjustments !important;

The Layers CSS grid now supports columns set to arbitrary break points. The stock responsive adjustments set uses 4 break points.

Regular columns continue to never break unless explicitly set.

`.center` columns are no longer supported. To reliably center content, you can

1. adjust the `max-width` or a `row-container`,
2. `.keep-center` a container element while setting a sensible `max-width`, or
3. `.push-` a `.column` (responsive versions available).

Furthermore, `.limit-` classes based on the breakpoints are now available. Refer to the documentation for more info.



## 1.0.6 - Saturday April 5, 2014

Switched width and max-width on text fields in `forms.css`. They're more intuitive and easier to override this way.

`.plain` inputs and buttons inherit text color.



## 1.0.5 - Monday March 3, 2014

Fixed `.absolute` positioning bug in `tools.css`. Prioritizing Helvetica over Lucida Grande as default font.



## 1.0.4 - Tuesday December 10, 2013

Updated default cursor for input elements in `_normalize.css`.



## 1.0.3 - Saturday November 30, 2013

Setting `outline-width` to 0 properly in `_normalize.css`.



## 1.0.2 - Friday October 25, 2013

Only `.plain` buttons inherit line-height.



## 1.0.1 - Tuesday October 22, 2013

List tools now work with definition lists, too. The following markups now work and make sense:

- `dl.plain`
- `dl.inline`
	- `dl.inline.center`
	- `dl.inline.right`
- `dl.collapse`
	- `dl.collapse.right`

Definition lists added to reference documentation as well.



## 1.0 - Friday October 18, 2013

First formal release. Latest additions include `.clear-after` and positioning tools.



# Known issues

## Overeffective `.last` definitions

Progressively enhanced columns do not cancel all previous, which might cause issues when skipping a breakpoints. Example:

	// Everything works
	.column.small-half.medium-fourth
	.column.small-half.medium-fourth.small-last
	.column.small-half.medium-fourth
	.column.small-half.medium-fourth.medium-last

	// `.small-last` will stay effective (remove margin) even on large screens.
	.column.small-half.large-fourth
	.column.small-half.large-fourth.small-last
	.column.small-half.large-fourth
	.column.small-half.large-fourth.large-last

This issue is caused by how progressive enhancements attempt to only cancel other column modifiers when needed. This issue can be worked around usually, and will probably be resolved in some future version of Layers.
